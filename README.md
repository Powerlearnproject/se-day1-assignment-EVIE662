#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering encompasses, designing, developing, testing and maintaining software. 
It helps in making work easier, whereby one app can be used in tracing how a certain activity has been performed from beginning to the end.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Early Foundations (1950s-1960s)
Birth of Computing and Early Programming Languages:
1950s: Early computers were developed, and the first programming languages such as Fortran (1957) and COBOL (1959) were created to facilitate software development.
Software Crisis:
1968: The term "software crisis" was coined by the NATO Software Engineering Conference to describe the difficulties in managing increasingly complex software systems and the need for better methodologies.
Development of Methodologies (1970s-1980s)
Waterfall Model:
1970: Winston W. Royce introduced the Waterfall Model, a sequential design process that became one of the earliest methodologies for software development. It involves distinct phases: requirements, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance.
Structured Programming:
1970s: Structured programming emerged as a methodology to improve code quality and maintainability by emphasizing clear, modular design and avoiding the use of "goto" statements.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
1980s: The principles of object-oriented programming, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, were popularized by languages such as Smalltalk (1972) and C++ (1983). OOP focuses on organizing code into objects that represent real-world entities.
Agile and Iterative Development (1990s-2000s)
Agile Manifesto:
2001: The Agile Manifesto was published, outlining principles for Agile software development that emphasize flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. This marked a shift from rigid, sequential methodologies to more adaptive approaches.
Extreme Programming (XP):
1999: Kent Beck introduced Extreme Programming (XP), an Agile methodology focused on iterative development, frequent feedback, and practices like Test-Driven Development (TDD) and pair programming.
Scrum Framework:
1995: The Scrum framework, developed by Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber, provided a structured approach to managing Agile projects with roles, ceremonies, and artifacts. It emphasizes iterative development and continuous improvement.
Test-Driven Development (TDD):
1990s: TDD became a prominent practice, advocating for writing tests before writing code to ensure high-quality software and facilitate refactoring.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement gatherings.This is the stage where you find out what the software should do.
Designing.In this phase you decide how the software will work and look.
Implementation. On this stage you  write the code that makes the software work.
Testing.It involves checking to make sure everything works as it should and finding and fixing any problems. 
Deployment. This is now releasing the sofware to the intended population so that it can be used.
Maintainance.Once the software is released, it is constantly updated and fix any new issues that come up.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
In Agile methodology work is  divided in small, workable parts of the project regularly and adapting to changes quickly while in waterfall methodology one has to follow to later the phases of software development.
Waterfall is linear and sequential, while Agile is iterative and flexible.
Waterfall provides a structured approach with clear phases, while Agile offers flexibility and continuous improvement.
Waterfall projects are more predictable in terms of timeline and scope, but less adaptable to change. Agile projects are more adaptable but may be less predictable.
Agile can be applied when coming up with a product while Waterfall can be applied when one is making contracts for different organizations


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer
S/He develops the structure and design of a particular software
S/He comes up with efficient codes based on users needs.
S/HE ensures the software works as intended and fix any issues. 
S/He keeps the software updated and functioning properly over time. 
S/HE should follow industry standards and practices for software development.
Quality assurance engineer
They support software engineers by ensuring that the final product meets the quality standards and is free of significant bugs or issues.
They provide critical feedback to developers, helping to improve the product and the development process.
QA Engineers often take on the role of the end user, helping to ensure that the software meets user expectations and provides a good user experience.
Poject manager
The project manager ensures that the software project is completed on time, within scope, and within budget while meeting the quality standards and stakeholder expectations. They act as the central point of coordination and communication, facilitating the smooth execution of the project and addressing any challenges that arise
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
 IDEs are essential in modern software engineering as they provide a comprehensive environment that simplifies the development process, enhances code quality, and boosts productivity. They enable developers to focus more on solving problems and writing high-quality code rather than managing tools and processes. Examples include but note limited to; Visual code, Atom, Eclipse, PyCham etc.
 Version Control Systems are important when it comes to providing mechanisms to track changes, manage versions, and collaborate on code. They include; Git, GitHub, Gitlab among others.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Software projects can become complex, making it difficult to understand and manage the codebase. This can be tackled breaking down the project into smaller managable services or also by documenting.
Bugs and issues are inevitable and can be time-consuming to identify and fix. This can be solved by using automated tools, debugging tools or issue tracking.

Rapidly changing technologies and tools can be overwhelming and require constant learning. With this one has to be willing to keep tabs with current developments and can only be achieved through constant learning.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Focuses on individual components to ensure they work correctly in isolation.
Integration Testing: Validates the interaction between components and their combined functionality.
System Testing: Tests the complete system to ensure it meets overall requirements and performs correctly in an environment similar to production.
Acceptance Testing: Confirms that the software meets business requirements and is ready for release to the customer.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompting engineering refers to the practice of creating and refining input prompts to effectively interact with and elicit desired responses from AI models, particularly large language models like chatGPT, Copilot.
By crafting precise, contextually relevant, and clear prompts, users can enhance the quality of responses, optimize model performance, and improve overall user experience. 
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt
What is engineering?
Improved
What is civil engineering and where is it applied.
By stating a specific type of engineering, I get to recieve information about that paricular discipline. This is more easy for me to comprehend and it doesn't consume a lot of time.
